# Student Complaint Register

This is a simple web-based application that allows students to register their complaints. The system collects the student's name and their complaint, then displays the complaints below the form.

## Features

- **Complaint Submission**: Students can enter their name and complaint, which is stored temporarily on the page.
- **Real-time Display**: Submitted complaints are displayed below the form as they are entered.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The interface is simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for creating the basic structure of the form and display area.
- **CSS**: Used to style the page and make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles form submission, validates inputs, and dynamically adds complaints to the list.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Download the project files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Open the Files Locally**  
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the complaint registration page.

3. **Submit a Complaint**  
   - Enter your name in the "Your Name" field.
   - Enter your complaint in the "Complaint" field.
   - Click "Submit Complaint."
   - Your complaint will be displayed below the form.

4. **Clear the Form**  
   After submitting a complaint, the form will reset to allow for new submissions.

## File Structure

```
/Student-Complaint-Register
  ├── index.html         # The HTML file containing the structure of the complaint form and display list.
  ├── style.css          # The CSS file used to style the page.
  └── scripts.js         # The JavaScript file that controls form submission and dynamic updates to the complaint list.
```

## Example of the HTML Structure

```html
<form id="complaintForm">
    <label for="name">Your Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" required placeholder="Enter your name">
    
    <label for="complaint">Complaint:</label>
    <textarea id="complaint" required placeholder="Enter your complaint"></textarea>
    
    <button type="submit">Submit Complaint</button>
</form>
```

## Notes

- The complaints are stored only for the current session and are cleared once the page is refreshed.
- This application does not store complaints in a database or on a server. For permanent storage, a backend (e.g., Node.js, PHP, etc.) would need to be integrated.
